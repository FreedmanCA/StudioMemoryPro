    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>We designed StudioMemory Pro to work without collecting personal information. This privacy policy explains how and why we collect, use, disclose, and retain personal information in connection with StudioMemory Pro installed on iOS and macOS devices.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection Through App</h2>
    <p>StudioMemory Pro does not collect users’ personal information in the normal course of use. You may use StudioMemory Pro without an account with us. StudioMemory Pro does not run advertising or analytics.</p>

    <h2>Paid Licenses</h2>
    <p>If you purchase a license to use StudioMemory Pro, the transaction is processed by Apple through the App Store. Apple may collect and use personal information to process payments, manage subscriptions, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations, and for other purposes explained in Apple's privacy information. We do not receive your payment details (e.g., credit card number). Depending on Apple’s systems, we may receive limited subscription-related signals needed to unlock features (for example, subscription status/entitlement, and purchase/renewal information). Your license subscription is managed in your Apple ID settings. For details on Apple’s data practices, review Apple’s privacy information and App Store terms.</p>

    <h2>Beta Testers</h2>
    <p>If you are invited to test a beta version of StudioMemory Pro, then you may voluntarily provide us with suggestions for fixes and improvements to StudioMemory Pro, and you may provide us with crash logs or diagnostic information through Apple's TestFlight (in accordance with your TestFlight settings). You consent to our use of your suggestions, information, and data to troubleshoot, fix, and improve StudioMemory Pro, and we will solely own all intellectual property we create based on your suggestions, information, and data.</p>

    <h2>Support Communications</h2>
    <p>If you voluntarily contact us by email for technical support regarding your use of StudioMemory Pro, you may voluntarily provide us with your relevant personal information — such as your email address, your name (if you include it), the content of your message, and the diagnostic information you choose to share (e.g., screenshots and diagnostic reports). You may not provide us with any sensitive or confidential information in connection with any support communications. By providing us with information in connection with a technical support request, you consent to our use of the information to respond to you, diagnose and troubleshoot issues, communicate about fixes or workarounds, and improve StudioMemory Pro and our technical support generally. We do not use technical support information for advertising or marketing purposes unless you explicitly ask to be contacted for that purpose.</p>

    <h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not share personal information with third parties except if required by law, or to protect our rights and users (e.g., fraud/security), or if you explicitly request or consent to sharing.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep records of support communications only as long as reasonably necessary to address the support request and for reasonable record-keeping and legal compliance purposes, then we delete the records or anonymize them where feasible. We are located in Vancouver, Canada, and we process and store information in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You can use StudioMemory Pro without providing your personal information. If you provide personal information in support correspondence, then you can assert your rights regarding the personal information by emailing freewolfsoftware@gmail.com from the same email address you used in the support communications, or by providing enough information for us to verify your identity and locate the support correspondence.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect any personal information you send us (e.g., in support correspondence). No method of information transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>StudioMemory Pro is not directed to children under 18 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal information will be governed by the version of this Policy in effect at that time. It is your responsibility to ensure that you read, understand, and accept the latest version of this Policy. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last Updated” above and post the changed policy at https://freedmanca.github.io/Freedman.ca/privacy.html.</p>
